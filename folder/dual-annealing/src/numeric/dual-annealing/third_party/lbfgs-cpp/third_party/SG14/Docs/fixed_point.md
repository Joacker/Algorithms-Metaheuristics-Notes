# Fixed-Point Real Numbers

[John McFarlane](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!profile/sg14/APn2wQdoie4ys78eOuHNF35KKYtO4LHy0d1z8jGXJ0cr5tzmqGbDbD7BFUzrqWrU7tJiBi_UnRqo)

Support for fixed-point arithmetic in the standard library is
proposed. It is described in paper,
[LEWG, EWG, SG14, SG6: D0037](Proposals/Fixed_Point_Library_Proposal.md).
An [experimental implementation](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/fixed_point)
is in development. Potential users are invited to provide feedback on
the [SG14 forum](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!forum/sg14).
